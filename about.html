                    <p class="info">The iron foundry was founded out of frustration. 
                        Frustration that there never seemed to be a gym around that had all that the 
                        avid gym goer wants. It seemed that if a gym was fun it was also expensive, and
                        if it was cheap it wasnt fun. Additionally, I could never find 
                        an enviornment that facilitated a good time. Tight spaces and noise policies 
                        kept enthusiasm in check.
                        After trying multiple gyms and not finding a good fit
                        I decided to simply make what I wanted. 
                        I made the Iron Foundry to make a place where people can push themselves without worry
                        of being told to be quiet or leave and for an affordable price. 
                        My mission was to make a place that increases ones energy and motivation instead of
                        confine it.
